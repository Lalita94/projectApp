1 Simon says game ->
simon says as a teaching Tool
The game of Simon Says is not a new game. In fact, many of us played it as kids and you either loved it or hated it.  In the old version of Simon Says, if you made a mistake what happened?  You were OUT!  Now I am a visual learner, so I was always one of those kids that got out first.  I was quick to follow what Simon did, rather than what Simon said.  So I was familiar with the 'walk of shame' after you realized you had made a mistake and then had to leave the game, usually with your head down in disappointment.
